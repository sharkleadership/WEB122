                    In this day and age, it is common to display information through scrolling webpages.
                    At other times, however, it may be more helpful to use an older method that has been used for centuries: paper.
                    CSS's module for paged media has the methods to convert websites into printable pages.
                    One might think that pages and paper are not especially relevant in the digital age,
                    but that is simply not the truth. Even if you are not using hard copy formats like paper,
                    the PDF, Portable Document Format, is still extensively used across many industries.
                    Being able to digitize documents and share them across the world no matter what operating system
                    you use is incredibly powerful.
                    Being able to print tabular data from a website can be very handy to view it easier as well,
                    especially in the case of mobile viewing.

                    The CSS Paged Media Module Level 3 is very new, having become a part of the CSS Baseline in December 2024.
                    This means that the top players in the browser world--Chromium, Firefox, and Safari--support
                    these features on their newest updates.
                    A little asterisk to add is that not all features in this module are supported in all browsers,
                    or, in the case of some features, any browsers.
                    Indeed, the module still only in the Working Draft phase.
                    Because of this, some features still are considered experimental, meaning their functionality could be changed later.
                    So, while it can be tempting to immediately go add all these new features to your website,
                    keep in mind that all of this is very new. Of course, if you only need to support the latest and greatest browsers,
                    by all means, go all out! But if you do need to support some older browsers,
                    or want to use some of the experimental features more consistently,
                    you may want to look into using polyfills like paged.js.

                    So how do we use this module?
                    Let us start with the at-rule <code class="code code--at-rule">@page</code>.
                    When used on its own, <code class="code code--at-rule">@page</code> selects all pages that will be created as a printable document.
                    This by itself can be useful, but what if we need more control, such as by selecting specific pages?
                    Luckily there are several ways we can be more granular: naming pages with the <code class="code">page</code> property, using pseudo-classes,
                    or a mixture of both.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <code class="code">page</code> property can be set on elements to indicate the page they should appear on.
                    This is useful to control widths of specific pages, or even the styling of specific pages.
                    There are four pseudo-classes that can be used with <code class="code code--at-rule">@page</code>:
                    <code class="code code--psuedo-class">:left</code>, <code class="code code--psuedo-class">:right</code>, <code class="code code--psuedo-class">:first</code>, and <code class="code code--psuedo-class">:blank</code>.
                    <code class="code code--psuedo-class">:first</code> does as you might expect, it targets the first page.
                    <code class="code code--psuedo-class">:blank</code> is also fairly straightforward, it targets pages that are blank, perhaps because of a page break.
                    The first two, <code class="code code--psuedo-class">:left</code> and <code class="code code--psuedo-class">:right</code> also do as you might expect; they target the left and right pages.
                    But how do we know which pages are right and which ones are left?
                    Well, we have to first look at what writing script we are using.

                    English, as we know, writes from left to right, top to bottom.
                    That is not the case for every single language, however.
                    Semitic languages such as Hebrew and Arabic, for example, write from right to left.
                    Japanese is an interesting case, since it may be written from left to right as it often is on the web,
                    but in more traditional settings may be written vertically from right to left.
                    The important thing to remember is that <strong>the page progression most often flows in the direction of the text.</strong>
                    This means that left-to-right languages like English start on the left and progress to the right.
                    Likewise, right-to-left languages do the same but in "reverse," starting on the right and going to the left.

                    Margins are so cool, in fact, that there are sixteen at-rules just to target parts of the margin around a page.

                    By default, browsers use the margins to display information about the website such as its URL and title,
                    as well as information about the document such as page number and time the document was assembled.
                    The placement of these items vary from browser to browser.
                    The aforementioned at-rules can be used to override these defaults.
                    It may be useful to change these default styles to fit with the overall theme of your document.
                    One quirk about these margin boxes is that they do not support the use of the <code class="code">position</code> property,
                    but still have access to the <code class="code">z-index</code> property as if they were positioned. These at-rules can be very powerful.
                    Unfortunately they are only supported in (most) Chromium-based browsers as of March 2025.
                    So, as mentioned before, you may have to use a polyfill to use these styles effectively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are two other properties related to margins, though most browsers have not implemented them yet.
                    These properties are <code class="code">marks</code> and <code class="code">bleed</code>.
                    <code class="code">marks</code> refers to crop marks on the border of the page to know where to cut the page.
                    Crop marks are used in industrial printing when an image will extend to the edge of the paper.
                    The printer is not precise enough to just stop, so we use crop marks to give the printer more room.
                    Bleeds are a similar concept.
                    Since the printer cannot just stop, the bleed area is the area outside the trim area that allows that room.

                    Counters, while not technically part of the Paged Media module,
                    can be very useful when used in conjunction with it.
                    Rather than having to use JavaScript to keep a running page number or chapter number, you can use pure CSS.
                    Counters work by defining the <code class="code">counter-reset</code> property on an element,
                    then using <code class="code">counter-increment</code> or <code class="code">counter-set</code> to change its value on subsequent elements.
                    Finally, you can use the <code class="code code--function">counter()</code> function to access the value of the counter.
                    Commonly, the value of the counter is used for chapters, pages, or lists,
                    but it can technically be used wherever a string could be in CSS.

                    Another useful thing to control is the size of the document and where to have page breaks.
                    Page breaking, like counters, is also not part of the Paged Media module, but is meant to be used alongside it.
                    It is part of the CSS Fragmentation module, which governs how content should be broken up to create pages in a document.
                    There are three different properties to control page breaks: <code class="code">break-before</code>, <code class="code">break-inside</code>, and <code class="code">break-after</code>.
                    Using these properties, you can designate when and where page breaks happen.
                    The two properties <code class="code">break-before</code> and <code class="code">break-after</code> have values to force a page break to happen or to avoid page breaks.
                    The <code class="code">break-inside</code> property, on the other hand, only has values to avoid breaks, since rarely,
                    if ever, would you want to force a page to break inside an element.
                    The default value of all three of these properties is <code class="code">auto</code>, meaning it will page break when it needs to.

                    <p>
                        These three properties existed in CSS 2.1, with slightly different names.
                        They were renamed when CSS3 and its modules came around.
                        They used to have <code class="code">page-</code> prefixed to them, but nowadays, browsers will alias the old properties to the correct ones.
                    </p>
                </aside>
                <p>
                    When thinking about page breaks, there is also the concept of <code class="code">orphans</code> and <code class="code">widows</code>.
                    Orphans in this context refer to the amount of lines that are left by themselves before a break.
                    Widows refers to the opposite: the amount of lines left by themselves after a break.
                    These can also help control the flow of the document.
                    For instance, you might not want to specify page breaks on specific blocks,
                    but you know you do not ever want one or two lines to be separated from the rest of the sentence.

                    To choose the size of the document created, we can use the aptly named <code class="code">size</code> property.
                    This property has many values it can take on.
                    You can specify the orientation of the document with the <code class="code">portrait</code> and <code class="code">landscape</code> values in addition to a size value.
                    You can really choose any size you want with length units like <code class="code">in</code>, <code class="code">cm</code>, <code class="code">mm</code>,
                    or other units that are valid in CSS such as <code class="code">em</code>.
                    Since the document may be printed at some point,
                    it may be helpful to stick to using real-life units such as inches or centimeters.
                    Luckily, to make things simple, there are prebuilt sizes we can choose from based on real-life paper sizes:

                I used 
                <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> 
                to code all the wonderful things you see here. 
                I used pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the majority of the website, with one exception.
                I had to use 
                <a href="https://pagedjs.org/">PagedJS</a> 
                as a polyfill for the printing styles for older browsers.
